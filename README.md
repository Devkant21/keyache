# Keyache

  The **keyache** package offers a memory-efficient caching solution using an **LRU (Least Recently Used)** mechanism. By combining a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** for fast key-value lookups with a doubly linked list for LRU management, it provides quick data retrieval while optimizing memory usage. This package is beneficial for applications needing efficient and automated caching to improve performance and reduce computational overhead.
