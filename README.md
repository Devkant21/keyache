# Keyache

  The **keyache** package introduces an enhanced caching solution using an **LRU** mechanism combined with **AVL trees**. This fusion offers efficient data retrieval with self-balancing capabilities, ensuring consistent **O(log n)** performance for insertions, deletions, and lookups. The **AVL-based LRU cache** optimizes memory usage by maintaining a balanced tree structure, providing a seamless balance between speed and memory efficiency. This package is ideal for applications requiring high-performance caching, offering improved responsiveness, reduced computational overhead, and efficient resource utilization
